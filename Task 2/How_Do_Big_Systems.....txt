Task 1: How Do Big Systems Store Data?
==================================================
- Instagram uses PostgreSQL for storing user data, photos, and hashtags.
  They use sharding to handle data growth rather than switching to NoSQL.

- Uber uses a combination of MySQL, PostgreSQL, Cassandra (NoSQL), and Redis
  for handling large-scale operations and ensuring performance.

- Amazon uses a hybrid approach: relational databases like Aurora and RDS,
  and NoSQL like DynamoDB depending on the use case.

- SQL Server usage: Many banks and financial institutions use SQL Server
  for secure, transactional data handling.

==================================================
Task 2: Do Video Games Use Databases?
==================================================
- Online games (PUBG, Fortnite) store player data such as scores,
  inventory, and profiles in relational databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL.

- massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) often rely on relational databases for consistent, structured data
  management across accounts and gameplay.

==================================================
Task 3: Can a Database Work Without the Internet?
==================================================
- Yes, offline systems such as military bases and aircraft use local
  databases that donâ€™t require internet access.

- SQL Server can be installed and run offline, making it suitable for
  environments without internet connectivity.

==================================================
Task 4: What Makes Online Stores So Fast?
==================================================
- E-commerce platforms like Amazon and Noon use both relational (MySQL)
  and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases.

- Cloud databases are widely used for high availability and speed.

- Challenges: Handling millions of product entries, fast search, and
  consistent availability.

==================================================
Task 5: How Do Banks Protect Their Data?
==================================================
- Banks rely on databases like Oracle and SQL Server with features such as:
  - Access control
  - Data encryption
  - Audit logging
  - Data integrity

- These databases support compliance with data security regulations.
